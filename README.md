## [Idle Poses](https://github.com/FUCKGIRLSUCCUBUS2/exploits/blob/main/anime_dimensions/idleposes.lua)
- Pointless but somewhat cool. ~not sure if it's serversided yet~ (It is)
- You can use different idle poses that only certain characters have. 
  - For example Six Paths Naruto's idle pose used with Rengoku looks nice.

- Default idle pose is Six Paths Naruto.

*Note: Characters that have the same idle pose won't be added such as Asuna and Astolfo.*
